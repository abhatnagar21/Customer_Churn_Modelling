# Customer_Churn_Modelling
A geodemographic segmentation model for predicting if a bank customer will leave the bank or stay
Customer churn modeling for a bank using deep learning involves applying neural network architectures to predict which customers are likely to churn. Deep learning models can effectively capture complex patterns in the data and provide accurate predictions. Here's how you can approach customer churn modeling for a bank using deep learning:

1.Data Collection and Preparation:

Gather relevant data from various sources within the bank's databases, including customer demographics, transaction history, account activity, customer service interactions, and any other relevant information.
Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies. Perform feature engineering to create meaningful features that can capture customer behavior and characteristics.

2. Data Splitting:

Split the data into training, validation, and test sets. The training set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and monitor performance during training, and the test set is used to evaluate the final model's performance.

3. Deep Learning Model Selection:

Choose an appropriate deep learning architecture for customer churn prediction. Common choices include:
Fully Connected Neural Networks (Multilayer Perceptron)
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequential data (e.g., transaction history).
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for processing structured data or images.
Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to find the one that best suits your data and problem.

4. Model Training:

Train the chosen deep learning model on the training data. Use techniques like mini-batch gradient descent and backpropagation to optimize the model's parameters.
Monitor the model's performance on the validation set and adjust hyperparameters as needed to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

5. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the trained model's performance on the test set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, or others depending on the business context.
Analyze the model's predictions and identify areas for improvement.

6. Deployment and Monitoring:

Deploy the trained deep learning model into production to make real-time predictions on new data.
Continuously monitor the model's performance and retrain it periodically with new data to ensure its effectiveness over time.

7. Interpretability and Explainability:

Deep learning models are often considered "black boxes" due to their complexity. Implement techniques such as feature importance analysis, partial dependence plots, or SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret and explain the model's predictions to stakeholders.
